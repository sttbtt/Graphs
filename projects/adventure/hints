While the map is not completely expolored
    For your current room
        If the room doesn't exist, initialize your room graph with '?' exists
        Update the graph entry for previous room
    If there is an unexplored exit in the current room (a '?' exit), travel in that direction
    Else, find the nearest room with and unexplored exit and travel there
        Call BFS to find nearest unexplored
        Convert room IDs to traversal path
        Walk along that traversal path
